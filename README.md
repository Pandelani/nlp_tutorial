# Fun With Natural Language Processing And Deep Learning

This repository contains notebooks exploring a few areas of deep learning and natural language processing that I have found fun and interesting when learning about NLP.

## But what the hell is a neural network?

Good question, and not an easy one to answer. This repository makes use of neural networks pretty frequently so it might be worth exploring more on the topic. A nice place to get started might be these videos:

#### But what *is* a neural network?
Click on the below images to go to the relevant videos that explore what neural networks actually do. The first is a quick overview that will probably answer a lot of questions, and the second is an entire course - probably overkill - but will explain and explore a lot of what is going on in modern libraries like TensorFlow.
